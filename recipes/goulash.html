        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt the pork lard or butter/oil in a Dutch oven or other heavy soup pot over 
                    medium high heat and cook the onions until beginning to brown, about 7-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the beef and cook until the beef is just starting to brown, 7-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the bell peppers, tomatoes, and garlic and cook for another 6-8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the paprika, salt, pepper and caraway 
                    (if using) (note: paprika becomes bitter if at all scorched).</li>
                <li>Add the beef broth, bay leaf, return to the stove and bring 
                    to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer for 40 minutes. </li>
                <li>Add the carrots and potatoes.  Return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, 
                    cover, and simmer for another 30-40 minutes or until the beef is nice and tender.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste.  Remove the bay leaf.</li>
